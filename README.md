- Run the two pieces of code to save the necessary image files.


## Step 2
- Use [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to create your AI model and get the model link.
- Save the **confusion matrix image** from the model.


## Step 3
- Open **index.html** and update the **const URL** part with the link to your AI model. (use notepad)
- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Upload the following files to your repository :
  -  index.html
  -  The confusion matrix image file
  -  Your modified assignment.ipynb file

  
## Step 4
